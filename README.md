Personally Identifiable Information (PII) includes any data that can be used to identify an individual, such as names, addresses, social security numbers, phone numbers, and email addresses. To protect PII in application logs, implementing a log filter that obfuscates these fields is essential. This can be achieved by using regular expressions or predefined patterns to detect PII and replace it with masked values, ensuring sensitive information is not exposed. When it comes to password security, encrypting passwords using algorithms such as bcrypt is a best practice. This involves hashing the password and storing the hashed version, which can then be used to check the validity of an input password by comparing it against the stored hash. For secure database authentication, using environment variables to store and retrieve credentials helps protect sensitive information. This practice ensures that credentials are not hard-coded into the application's source code, reducing the risk of accidental exposure.
